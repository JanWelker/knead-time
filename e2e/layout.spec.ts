// against the structure that exists now ("the plan comes before the weights,
// and the settings are past both", "the settings are a rail beside the
// instrument, not a column ahead of it").

// A <label> names its FIRST labelable descendant, so wrapping a date box and a
// time box in one label left both time boxes with no accessible name at all —
// on the two inputs the whole app schedules from. Caught in the accessibility
// tree, not in the markup, which is why this lives in the browser suite.
